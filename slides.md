## Fair Dealing & Your Thesis



Note:

Your thesis will be deposited in cIRcle and with Library and Archives Canada, and so must be copyright compliant.

Fair Dealing gives you a bit of wriggle room:

## Copyright & Publishing Thesis Chapters



Note:

I'm not going to get into this in any depth, but want to highlight that there is definite benefit to this and that there are necessary considerations. And our Scholarly Communications librarian will be running a workshop on exactly this:

## It's Not Simple

Note:

That's why there's help.

Copyright at UBC has a page dedicated to copyright and your thesis

---

## Licence Your Own Work



Note:

If we want others to be able to use what we have produced, we should outline what we would like to permit, whether that be restrictive or open.

The Creative Commons pre-canned licences, with human readable interpretations, are a great option for this.

# Scholarly Communications

## What is Scholarly Communications?

Note:

I would suggest that there are two main paths of communication of one's research outputs: there is a path of immediacy and intrigue, whether that be in social media, blogs, letters to editors, news coverage etc...

Often this is a very different kind of engagement than we might expect from a published journal article, or even a poster at a conference. And communicating across these two channels will require slightly different approaches largely because of how the content is consumed.

The former - social media, blogs, etc - are often pushed content, that is people don't have to go looking for it, instead it arrives in the palm of their hand or in their inbox - what we choose to read will depend in part on how intriguing, novel, or contentious the content is. And so, we might really try to make that content look intriguing or novel.

The latter arguably becomes more intrinsically a part of academic dialogue; a dialogue that quickly becomes sought by database searches. So we want to ensure that our work is discoverable.

Aside from suggesting that you might wish to use things like social media to either stay on top of certain individuals in your field or to participate in this dialogue, I'll leave this aspect of communication alone here.

But we should look a bit more closely at those aspects that might more directly influence your academic CV.

## Academic Profiles

* 

Note:

So, first , we need to ensure that our works can be collated and that we can be disambiguated.

Two that you should definitely try and maintain are a Google Scholar Profile and an ORCiD.

ORCiD's are the equivalent to a publication's DOI or perhaps your SIN. As a unique identifier for authors, they allow resolving name changes, researchers with the same name, varying articulations of author affiliations etc.

ORCiD is member funded and based on open standards. ORCiD's do not offer metrics, but they enable more accurate metrics on other platforms.

Metrics based profiles you should investigate include

Google Scholar does a great job of trying to amass works that you've authored and is a familiar tool for many people. It will also provide you with an H-index metric that you can report on.

2 others that you should be familiar with are the ResearcherID provided by Web of Science and author ID provided by Scopus. These will similarly provide you with an H-index caluclated from the citations available in their respective databases.

## Where, How & What to Publish



Note:

Another key aspect to scholarly publishing is choosing where and how to publish.

Two key aspects here, you want your work to be discoverable and connected. So, if someone sees your poster at a conference, you want them to be able to find you and any affiliated publications. If they find your publication, you want them to be able to locate you, your data, your posters etc.

---

## How do we do this?

---

## First



Note:

Use your ORCiD when registering for a conference or submitting a publication; this will allow any auto generated content to do its thing.

---

## Second

* 

Note:

Think about how you'll organize all the outputs from your research, considering:

---

## Third

* 
  

Note:

And then consider how you can cite each of these to create a cookie crumb trail.

Deposit or register your protocols on OSF or Zenodo along with your data collection tool. Place your raw data if permissible in the same place. Use Scholar's Portal Dataverse for the final data set(s) that supported your publication. Deposit your posters in cIRcle. Publish Open Access if an option, otherwise deposit a pre-print in a pre-print server.

All of these services will provide a unique, permanent url with citable meta data. Thus, find any one of these items, and you're linked to all of the others. Better yet, use OSF as a central hub for your project and connect everything in one place.

---

## How do we do this?



Note:

We have two workshops coming up on OSF, one that will demo a project of this complexity and one that will introduce users to the OSF interface.

---

## Lastly...



Note:

Lastly, consider where you'd like your work to be found and check to see what journals are indexed there. Not every medical journal is in PubMed nor Web of Science. So take a look at your options.

# Research Data Management

---

## Give Your Data a Little Love

Note:

Data underpins absolutely everything we do in research. We ask questions that are answered by data. We build data collection tools. We interpret and analyze our data. We report on what we believe our data are able to tell us. Data kind of sits at the centre of everything, but gets very little love.

## A Can of Worms

* 

Note:

Research Data Management is an astronomical topic. It boils down to:

* Be purposeful in what you're collecting / gathering and why. This is where a protocol is very valuable.
* Kind of goes without saying, and you've probably been hit over the head with this since starting school, but being organized goes a long way in saving time and effort in the long run
* In addition to point one, think about articulating the kind of data you'll be collecting, how you'll store it, how you'll organize it, and how you'll analyze it. This will help to limit the unexpected, but also to onboard new partners to the project. Again, a protocol is an invaluable tool here.
* This is really about how the data that you collect might be used / interpreted in the future and is of particular relevance when collecting human data - will we want to re-purpose it, share it etc and have we baked this in to our ethics and consent forms or licence agreements if collected in partnership with others?
* Have multiple copies in multiple locations and always have one copy that is untouched!
* Tacit knowledge is your friend until your memory goes foggy or your not the one with the tacit knowledge, so we should bake as much of this into our data as possible and the kind of meta data we should be considering include who, when, how, what (including labels and data types), licences etc
* Consider options for depositing data, either to contribute to a larger repository (GenBank), to support a publication (Dataverse or Dryad), or simply for transparency and reproducibility (OSF, Dataverse, Zenodo)
* Make sure people know how to use your data!
